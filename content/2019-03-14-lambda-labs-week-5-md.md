Provide a paragraph (5-8 sentences) summarizing the work you did over the course of this sprint, including the challenges you faced, the tools you used, and your accomplishments



Detailed Analysis

Pick one of your tickets and provide a detailed analysis of the work you did. This should be approximately ¼ page of text, and include screenshots if appropriate



# Part 2 - Weekly Reflection

As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to bring an application to completion. The 90-90 rule is a quip referencing the very real difficulty of truly completing a project. Describe some of the final tasks that were the most difficult for your team to resolve - challenging bugs, layout and presentation woes, or anything else that was easy to get mostly working, but hard to get perfect.
